## Top States Circle Packing 

This is the same data from the bar chart example.  It shows the top states for the selected age bracket sorted by population percentage. 
The circle size, however, is using the actual by population count for all of the age brackets.
The chosen age bracket is given a black fill.
It doesn't make for a great visualization, but is testing a more complex set of transitions that happen in a sequence.
