## Stacked Area Chart

The data used in the chart below is fake.  It shows series of data for 10 randomly chosen fruit names.  There are 100 points for each of the series being interpolated on the transitions.
It uses the same data generator used in Mike Bostock's [stream graph example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954).
If you refresh the page you will get a new random dataset.
